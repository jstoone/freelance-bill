## On a sidenote
Like almost every other project, feel free to submit pull, bug and feature requests, since we're all different we might have different needs (logic).
Please don't get hurt if I turn down your request, either it's because I'm mean and don't see it fitting the project, or else it's really good, but I would like to implement it in another way. I'm the maintainer after all. :)

You're awesome!
